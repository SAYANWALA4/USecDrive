# USecDrive
Encrypts and Decrypts data to store on local or the cloud 
This program has a GUI and a CLI, I wouldnt try using it yet because I think the program is now messed up and super buggy. 
If your using this program, I would suggest using it on a VM or docker containters.
I mean if you still acidently Encrypt your drive try to write down the key so that you could get back your data potentially.
Steps of data recovery if drive is encrypted would be messy so therefore please dont use it on your main machine.
